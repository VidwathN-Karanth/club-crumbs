 * What every admin screen shares: who is signed in, and which club
 * they are looking at.
 *
 * The console shows exactly one club at a time and every admin API route
 * demands an explicit `?cohort=`, so this selection has to survive moving
 * between sections. It used to be local state inside one 3,000-line page,
 * which is precisely why the console could not be split into pages.
 *
 * The choice is remembered in localStorage rather than in the synced store: it
 * is a per-device view preference, not workspace data, and it must not travel
 * to a student's device through the state blob.
