            </div>
            <p>
              Club Crumbs tracks users' daily coding activity by connecting to:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 text-white/70">
              <li><strong className="text-white">GitHub:</strong> via GitHub's official GraphQL API, to read your contribution and commit activity.</li>
              <li><strong className="text-white">LeetCode:</strong> via an unofficial, publicly accessible GraphQL endpoint, to read your public submission activity.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Club Crumbs uses this data to calculate daily coding points and display them on a public leaderboard. Club Crumbs is <strong className="text-white">not affiliated with GitHub or LeetCode</strong>. Since the LeetCode integration relies on an API that LeetCode has not officially published for third-party use, it may be modified, rate-limited, or discontinued at any time without notice, which could affect point calculation or sync accuracy.

            <p>
              Club Crumbs does not impose a minimum age requirement to use the Service. However, under the Indian Contract Act, 1872, a person under the age of 18 is not considered competent to enter into a binding contract. <strong className="text-white">If you are under 18, you may only use Club Crumbs with the consent and involvement of a parent or legal guardian</strong>, who must agree to these Terms on your behalf and takes responsibility for your use of the Service.

            </div>
            <p>
              By connecting your GitHub or LeetCode account, you authorize Club Crumbs to access the relevant public activity data for the purpose of calculating coding points. You are responsible for ensuring your use of these integrations complies with GitHub's and LeetCode's own terms of service. Club Crumbs is not responsible for any disruption, suspension, or restriction imposed on your GitHub or LeetCode account as a result of using our integration, nor for any inaccuracy resulting from changes to either platform's API.
