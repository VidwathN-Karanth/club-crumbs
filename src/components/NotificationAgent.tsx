 * permission. Nothing talks to an outside service.
 *
 * Three things are announced:
 *   1. Today's agenda, every time the workspace is opened — including a plain
 *      "nothing on today" so silence is never ambiguous.
 *   2. Each timetable block, shortly before it starts.
 *   3. Each course reminder — at its time, or on the next open after it if the
 *      workspace was closed then.
 *
 * Blocks and courses are marked as sent for the day, so a reload does not
 * repeat them. Renders nothing.
