/**
 * The bridge between the Layora website and this extension.
 *
 * Runs only on Layora's /extension page. The page mints a pairing token for
 * whoever is signed in and posts it to its own window; this relays it to the
 * service worker, which stores it.
 *
 * Why a content script rather than `externally_connectable`: that route needs
 * the page to know the extension's ID, and an unpacked install gets a random
 * one. This way the connect button works the moment the folder is loaded, with
 * nothing to configure. The manifest keeps `externally_connectable` as well,
 * for a Web Store build where the ID is fixed.
 *
 * Only messages from this page's own window are accepted, so another frame
 * cannot inject a token or ask for ours.
 *
 * A content script cannot import, so the namespace is resolved inline here.
 * sendMessage is used in its promise form, which both engines support — the
 * callback form is Chromium-only and would be read as an options bag by
 * Firefox.
 *
 * Everything is wrapped in an IIFE because every content script listed for the
 * same document shares one scope: a bare `const` here would collide with an
 * identically named one in a sibling script, and a redeclaration aborts them
 * all — silently, with the page looking perfectly fine.
