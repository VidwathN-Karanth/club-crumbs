"""Package the extension for distribution.

Writes two zips from the one source folder, because the two engines disagree
about exactly one manifest key:

    public/layora-extension.zip          Chrome, Edge, Brave, any Chromium
    public/layora-extension-firefox.zip  Firefox

Only the manifest differs; every script is byte-identical between them. The
differences are forced, not stylistic:

  * Firefox's MV3 has no background service worker. It runs a non-persistent
    event page instead, declared as `background.scripts`. background.js already
    registers all its listeners synchronously at top level and keeps its state
    in storage, so it needs no change to run as one.
  * `externally_connectable` is Chromium-only. Dropping it from the Firefox
    build costs nothing — connect.js, the content script, is the pairing path
    that actually runs, and the manifest key is only the Web Store fallback.
  * Firefox needs an add-on id of its own and an explicit data-collection
    declaration, which AMO now requires of every new extension. The version
    floor is 142 because that declaration is itself only understood from 142
    onwards; ES modules in background scripts, the other hard requirement here,
    landed well before that at 128.

Run from the repository root:

    python extension/build-zip.py

Re-run it after any change in this folder — the zip is a build artifact that
happens to be committed, because Vercel only serves what is in public/.
